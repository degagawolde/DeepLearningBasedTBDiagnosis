# Deep Learning Based Chest X-ray Diagnosis

[Chext x-ray](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chest-x-rays/about/pac-20393494) produce images of organs located under the chest(heart, lungs, blood vessels, airways, and the bones of chest and spine). Chest X-rays can also reveal fluid in or around the lungs or air surrounding a lung
is a chest radiography used for the diagnosis for diseases attacking lung. Radiologists can look at the image and examine if there is anomalies in the x-ray image. In this project, we traiend a deep learning model-[MobileNetV2 (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/mobilenet_v2/MobileNetV2) for the diagnosis of the chest x-ray images.
