# Deep Learning Based Chest X-ray Diagnosis

Chext x-ray is a chest radiography used for the diagnosis for diseases attacking lung. Radiologists can look at the image and examine if there is anomalies in the x-ray image. In this project, we traiend a deep learning model[MobileNetV2]([docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/mobilenet_v2/MobileNetV2)) for the diagnosis of the chest x-ray images.
